QUESTION#32
Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
• Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.

• Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

• Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.

• Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.

ANSWER
let current_users = ["ahmed", "hira", "kashaf", "zareenkhan", "amber"];
let new_users = ["sahar", "shazia", "mariyam", "amhed", "horain"];
for (var i = 0; i < new_users.length; i++) {
  for (var j = 0; j < current_users.length; j++) {
    if (new_users[i]=== current_users[j]) {
      console.log("person will need to enter a new username");
    }else{
      console.log("available");
    }
    } 
  }
