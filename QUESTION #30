QUESTION #30
Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
• If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

ANSWER

let user_name = ["ahmed", "hira", "admin", "kashaf", "zareenkhan", "amber"];
for (var i = 0; i < user_name.length; i++) {
  if (user_name[i] === "admin") {
    console.log(
      "Hello " + user_name[i] + ",would you like to see a status report?"
    );
  } else {
    console.log("Hello " + user_name[i] + ",thank you for logging in again.");
  }
}
