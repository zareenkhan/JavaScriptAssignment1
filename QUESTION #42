QUESTION #42
Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() 
that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. 
Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
ANSWER
let megician_name=["ahmed", "hira", "kashaf", "zareenkhan", "amber"];
function show_magicians(megician_name){
  for (var i = 0; i < megician_name.length; i++){
    console.log(megician_name[i]);
  }
}
function make_great(){
  for (var i = 0; i < megician_name.length; i++){
  console.log("the great",megician_name[i])
  }
}
make_great()
show_magicians(megician_name)
