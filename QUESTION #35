QUESTION #35

Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, 
and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. 
Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would
make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of
your program stating what these animals have in common.
You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

ANSWER:
let animals=["rabbit","duck","cat"];
for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
  console.log("A "+animals[i]+" would make a great pet.");
} console.log("These are my favourite animals");
